# MusicPlayer

This is a sample portfolio project written using Angular2, with Typescript and SCSS. All the components are written from scratch. I also use Google Material icons for additional aesthetic views (on top of, otherwise, text-only contents).

##Concept

Recently, I wanted to know how far have HTML5 and Javascript support multimedia contents since the days of Flash and Actionscript. For that, I decided to give it a try to build this simple web-based music player. I used SCSS and Angular2(+Typescript) to build this for ease of development.

## Future references

I believe there is a lot more that can be done for faster, more efficient development (Eg., I do find the visualiser is taking up too much memory consumption). Other than that, I am satisfied for my first try, and impressed by how far has web standards improve.

## Feedbacks

I still have more to learn (such is life for a developer), so feel free to check my codes and drop me some comments at tendoujir@gmail.com.
